Setup: The game is for 2-10 players, ages 7 and over. Every player starts with seven
cards, and they are dealt face down.
The rest of the cards are placed in a Draw Pile face down. Next to the pile a space 
should be designated for a Discard Pile.
The top card should be placed in the Discard Pile, and the game begins!
Game Play: The first player is normally the player to the left of the dealer 
(you can also choose the youngest player) and
gameplay usually follows a clockwise direction. Every player views his/her 
cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.
You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action. 
For instance, if the Discard Pile has a red card that is 
an 8 you have to place either a red card or a card with an 8 on it. 
You can also play a Wild card (which can alter current color in play).
If the player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their 
cards even though they might have a match, they must draw a
card from the Draw pile. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, 
the game moves on to the next person in turn. You can 
also play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card on your turn.
Note: If the first card turned up from the Draw Pile (to form the Discard Pile) 
is an Action card, the Action from that card
applies and must be carried out. The exceptions are if the Wild or Wild Draw Four
cards are turned up, in which case - Return
them to the Draw Pile, shuffle them, and turn over a new card. At any time, 
if the Draw Pile becomes depleted and no one has
yet won the round, take the Discard Pile, shuffle it, and turn it over to regenerate a new Draw Pile.
There are two different ways to play regarding drawing new cards. 
The Official Uno Rules states that after a card is drawn 
the player can discard it if it is a match, or if not, play passes on 
to the next player. The other type is where players
continue to draw cards until they have a match, even if it is 10 times
The game continues until a player has one card left.
The moment a player has just one card they must yell "UNO!"
If they are caught not saying "Uno" by another player before any card 
has been played, the player must draw two new cards
Once a player has no cards remaining, the game round is over, points
 are scored, and the game begins over again. Normally,
veryone tries to be the first one to achieve 500 points, but you can
also choose whatever points number to win the game, as long as everyone agrees to it

Skip
When a player places this card, the next player has to skip their turn. If turned up at the beginning, the first player loses his/her turn
Draw Two
When a person places this card, the next player will have to pick up two cards and forfeit his/her turn
Wild
This card represents all four colors, and can be placed on any card. The player has to state which color it will represent for the next player.
It can be played regardless of whether another card is available.
